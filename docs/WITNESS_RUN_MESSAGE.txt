NEURALOGIX VOR WITNESS RUN — v0.7.3
=====================================

This message contains instructions to verify the NeuraLogix Verified Observation Runtime
on a clean machine. The goal is to confirm that the public demo package produces
deterministic, hallucination-free outputs under the audited conditions.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
- Python 3.9+
- Git
- ~500MB disk space

VERIFICATION COMMANDS (copy-paste block)
-----------------------------------------
# Clone and checkout the witness-green tag
git clone https://github.com/CULPRITCHAOS/NUERALOGIX-H.git
cd NUERALOGIX-H
git checkout v0.7.3

# Create clean virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
# source .venv/bin/activate

# Install package with test dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Run full test suite (should pass with 150+ tests)
pytest

# Validate pack integrity
neuralogix pack validate --pack data/packs/public_demo_v0_7_1
neuralogix pack validate --pack data/packs/adversarial_v1

# Run VOR audit (hallucination gate)
neuralogix audit --fast

EXPECTED OUTPUTS
----------------
1. pytest:       "150+ passed" (exact count may vary; 0 failures)
2. pack validate: "Pack validated successfully" for each pack
3. audit --fast:  "Hallucination Rate: 0.00%" across all strategies

WHAT TO SEND BACK ON FAILURE
----------------------------
If any step fails, please capture:
1. The exact command that failed
2. The full console output (stdout + stderr)
3. Your Python version: python --version
4. Your OS and version
5. The output of: git rev-parse HEAD

Send to: Open a GitHub issue at https://github.com/CULPRITCHAOS/NUERALOGIX-H/issues and attach logs

WHAT THIS PROVES
----------------
A successful witness run demonstrates:
- The VOR kernel correctly rejects ungrounded observations
- The Truth Gate produces 0% hallucination on audited packs
- Evidence trails are cryptographically reproducible
- The system abstains when evidence is insufficient (no fabrication)

WHAT THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE
--------------------------
This public demo excludes:
- Proprietary corpus ingestion pipelines
- Internal/customer-specific evaluation packs
- Pack generation recipes and gold-label construction
- Domain-specific parsing extensions
